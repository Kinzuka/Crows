# Crows
A Roguelite with JRPG style character switching
Hi. so this is my first project using pygame and it's pretty ambitious but the idea is to create a simple game which
1) Generatesa 2D dungeon with various rooms that are procedurally generated
2) has a selection of 4 charcters, each with different stats in speed, strength, etc.
3) the ability to switch into any of these characters during gameplay depending on the situation
Just a note. Speed of development and clean buglessness should be the priority
